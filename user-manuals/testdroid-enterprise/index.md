Bitbar On-premise is a SaaS solution serving thousands of customers online daily. Even though we strive for customer data security we understand that some need to have full control over their environment and want to host their own devices. For this reason our product can also be installed locally to enterprise environments. We call this Enterprise Cloud. 

For further information on how to get your own Enterprise Cloud set up, hear about our customer testimonials and much more, please contact our sales at <sales@bitbar.com>.
