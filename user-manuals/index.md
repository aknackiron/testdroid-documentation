Bitbar Testing cloud provides the largest device farm of real mobile devices, gathered from different regions globally. Bitbar Testing provides a test automation environment, remote manual access and REST API to access, run and manage any tests with these devices.

Testsdroid Cloud comes in three flavors. Publicly available [Bitbar Testing](http:/cloud.testdroid.com) for testing your application on shared iOS and Android devices. Bitbar Testing makes it possible to run automated or manual tests on real devices and share test projects between team members. 

For additional security and dedicated devices it is possible to get Bitbar Private cloud or Bitbar On-premise cloud. Testing Private cloud provides a dedicated service with dedicated devices managed and monitored by us. An Enterprise installation provides the same service and dedicated devices but installed at customer premises and maintained by the customer. In such installations all information stays inside customer premises.
