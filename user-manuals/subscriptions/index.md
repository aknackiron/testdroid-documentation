How to add new subscriptions to your Bitbar Testing cloud account.

## Creating a Sub Account User

A user having a paid plan is called main user in Bitbar Testing. He's able
to add subaccount users whose runs he's willing to pay. Subaccount
users will inherit the same plan and roles than the main user.
 
**Note!** Projects between main and subaccount are not shared by
  default. They need to share separately.
 
You can add a subaccount user following these steps.
 
## Go To Subscription Menu
