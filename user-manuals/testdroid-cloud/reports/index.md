The following steps will help users to create reports regarding their
needs:

first step is to specify the report type. Users can choose different
report types from the dropdown list placed in the upper left part of
the module. The report type list is divided into two parts: "Projects"
(reports for projects) and "Test runs" (reports for test runs). After

drop-downs menu will be updated accordingly.

window is hidden. Users can activate the preview window by clicking

preview window users can review reports before downloading them. The
preview window refreshes after every change is made.
