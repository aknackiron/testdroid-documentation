The following steps will help users to create reports regarding their
needs:

1. **Specify the report type.** After selecting the reports tool, the
first step is to specify the report type. Users can choose different
report types from the dropdown list placed in the upper left part of
the module. The report type list is divided into two parts: "Projects"
(reports for projects) and "Test runs" (reports for test runs). After
you select an option in this list the values in the other two
drop-downs menu will be updated accordingly.

1. **Choose the data source.** When user have specified the type of
report, user can choose from which of the projects/test runs user
wants to generate the report.

1. **Specify report format.** In the last drop-down menu you can choose
your preferred format (PDF, HTML or CSV).

1. **Preview window.** When user starts the reports module the preview
window is hidden. Users can activate the preview window by clicking
the text "Change selected values or click this text to refresh
preview" or by changing values in the drop-down lists. Thanks to the
preview window users can review reports before downloading them. The
preview window refreshes after every change is made.

reports, they can download the selected report by clicking the
"Download report" button.
