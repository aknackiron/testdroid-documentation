## Test Automation

Developing mobile applications is very different from developing PC
software or even embedded software. Mobile development is meant to be
agile, and a lot of great tools and practices have been developed for
that agility. However, doing something manually — such as testing an
app — is never agile, which is why test automation has shown
tremendous growth among app and game developers, speeding up their
doings and yielding robust and better results.

All Bitbar products have been built for test automation. The remote
manual access to devices on our data centers complements this offering
and occasionally developers want to make sure their apps work just
like they've planned - and this is where our Bitbar Testing manual testing is
extremely useful.

Test Automation relies real mobile devices (Android, iOS) and offers
the possibility to test mobile apps and websites instantly and
effectively using test automation frameworks. Our infrastructure is
build to support unlimited number of simultaneous test runs, meaning
that you can select any number of devices for your test run.

The true benefit of test automation comes from these simultanous test
runs, automated access, coverage, and runs on devices, repeatability
nature of tests, and identical and accurate tests - that could
probably never get to accurate with manual testing.

* **Open Standards** - Our test automation relies only on
open standards that are widely used in the industry. Open standards
mean there are no vendor lock-ins, source code is always open and
available, and developers can incrementally develop new tests and
focus on compelling features with their apps.

* **Automation without Complexity** - Automated testing
can increase the depth and scope of tests and significantly improve
software quality. Lengthy and thorough tests — often not doable with
manual testing — can be run automatically. Automated tests can easily
execute thousands of complex test cases during every test run,
providing coverage that is simply not possible with manual testing.

* **Cost Efficient and Effective** - Depending on the
size of the project and the application, test automation will always
provide a good return on investment. Once tests have been created,
automated tests can be run over and over again at no additional
cost. Test automation typically reduces the time required to run
repetitive tests from weeks to hours. This is a significant
time-saving that translates directly into cost-saving.

* **Integration with Agile Process and Tools** - To get
the most out of your efforts and maximize testing coverage, select the
most robust and most cross-platform method - and hook it up with your
continuous integration, development and deployment system. Once you
build an app, the system can automatically push it for testing on
devices on cloud. This saves a lot of time, produces instant results
and developers can fix any issues instantly.

In order to automate your mobile testing, you can use different types
of procedures and methods to accomplish the real device coverage,
compatibility and full functional testing. For example, there are
three ways to produce tests for any mobile application:

* **Handwritten Tests** - Typically, this is the best
choice when you know what you’re doing and when you have
programming-capable people doing the test scripts. Plenty of options
are available for test automation frameworks, tools and integration —
both commercial and open-source offerings. Having your engineers write
all of the test scripts will take up some time and tie up resources,
but it will get you exactly what you want: well-structured, thorough
scripts that test precisely the aspects of your app that you want to
test.

* **Record and Playback Approach** - This approach is
typically limited in functionality. Tests can be
recorded and played back again and again against different OS
versions and device configurations. These tests focus on user
interactions and user-driven activities. Some things might fall beyond
a test’s scope (such as integration with other technologies and
compatibility with other software).

* **Automatic Test Exercisers** - Automatic test
exercisers provide a great way to smoke-test applications. No specific
tests are needed; rather, the focus is on testing user-interface logic
(such as opening menus, clicking buttons, swiping and multi-gesture
actions). Automatic test exercisers yield the least exact results but
provide quick feedback on each iteration of an app.
