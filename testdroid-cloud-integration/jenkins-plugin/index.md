There are two ways to get notification from Bitbar Testing about finished test runs.
 
### API CALL

Jenkins is polling Bitbar Testing for results. Test results are copied to Jenkins workspace after the tests are finished.

### HOOK URL

Bitbar Testing sends post message to defined URL when test run is finished. RiC listens the message in default location and downloads results when post message arrives. The listened URL can be changed.

POST message body:

    testRunId=%s&projectId=%s&status=FINISHED

**Note!** This requires HOOK URL to be reachable from Internet ie. Jenkins instance can be reached from Bitbar Testing.
