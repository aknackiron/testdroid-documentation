title: Apple Testing Frameworks
---


Applications created for Apple iOS devices can be tested with multiple different testing frameworks of which Apple only supports its own testing frameworks XCTest and XCUITest. These frameworks are also available and supported by Bitbar Testing cloud. XCTest and XCUITest are integrated with XCode and support writing of test suites with subclasses, methods and assertions.

Tests are run directly from Xcode and are written with either Swift or Objective C. XCUITest makes use of the application's accessibility functionality, which allows tests to interact with the app as a real user would.

There are separate documentations for [preparing the application](./ipa/) for testing through Xcode and how to [package XCTest tests](./xctest/).
