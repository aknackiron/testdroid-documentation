## REST API

Testdroid provides a compelling REST API for its users to manage all aspects of mobile development and testing automatically. The integration API will bridge your development tools, environment with our real Android and iOS devices on Bitbar Testing and Bitbar Private cloud services.

This [Bitbar Testing API Reference Guide]({{site.github.url}}/testdroid-cloud-integration/api/) includes the full reference guide to our integration API.
