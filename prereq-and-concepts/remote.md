## Remote Manual Access

Remote manual access allows you to start a session on any mobile
device we host at Bitbar Testing. This provides a comprehensive way
to manually test your mobile apps, games and web-related products. As
all these devices are real you can install other applications, use
available browsers, internet access, and also Google Play / App Store
to download and configure your device session.

The feature is called Bitbar Testing Manual Testing. By clicking *Manual testing*
in the main menu, user will be directed to the *Manual testing* setup view.

the widget and then select application for a manual session.

   User can pick up the device and use filters on the left-hand side
   to quickly browse desired device. NOTE! If certain device is not

   lock picture on top of it.
