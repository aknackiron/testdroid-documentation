## Remote Manual Access

Remote manual access allows you to start a session on any mobile
device we host at Testdroid Cloud. This provides a comprehensive way
to manually test your mobile apps, games and web-related products. As
all these devices are real you can install other applications, use
available browsers, internet access, and also Google Play / App Store
to download and configure your device session.

The feature is called Testdroid Interactive. By clicking *Manual testing*
in the main menu, user will be directed to the *Manual testing* setup view.

Users can upload their applications by clicking *Upload file* on top of
the widget and then select application for a manual session.

1. Select application for the session

   application. More applications can be uploaded and all are shown in
   this view. If you don't have or don't want to upload any app you can
   also proceed without it.

   User can pick up the device and use filters on the left-hand side
   to quickly browse desired device. NOTE! If certain device is not
   available (used by some other user) it will be shown with grayed
   lock picture on top of it.

   After this the Interactive session will be opened with the selected
