## Devices

Testdroid Cloud provides the largest device farm of real mobile
devices, gathered from different regions globally, including the most
versatile OS, OEM and hardware configurations for Android and iOS
developers. Testdroid Cloud provides a test automation, remote manual
access and REST API to access, run and manage any tests with these
devices.

Testdroid Cloud is a mobile app, game and web testing service that
enables developers to run their tests on real, physical Android and
iOS devices that are all hosted on our secure premises. These devices
are hosted in three different locations - Wroclaw, Poland, Mountain
View, CA and Oulu, Finland - and are monitored and maintained 24 hours
per business day. Our up-time is over 99% and sophisticated monitoring
system keeps our devices running at the same rate.

The devices, infrastructure, test runs and assets will be maintained
and all data resides on our premises.

The test reports contain detailed information about the execution of
app on these devices, with access to logs, pixel-accurate screenshots,
performance statistics/data, as well as high-level result overview of
success/failure of the test runs. All this data will be available when
test run on each device in completed. The data is downloadable and
considered as your own asset.

Testdroid Cloud allows users to upload their own tests or use
built-in, script-free compatibility tests and crawlers. Devices can be
used in parallel with test automation frameworks. For remote manual
access only one device can be used at time.

Testdroid Cloud provides support for native, hybrid and web apps on
Android and iOS devices and browsers. Any applications created on
PhoneGap, Titanium, Xamarin, Unity or some other framework are fully
supported at Testdroid Cloud devices.

The supported test automation frameworks include:
