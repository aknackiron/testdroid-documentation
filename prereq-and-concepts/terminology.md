## Terminology

All Testdroid products use the same terminology when it comes to
testing, assets, test types, runs, projects and so on:

**Project** - This is a project workspace that contains
test runs, descriptions of project, device groups where tests are
executed and all results and test assets. Projects enable you to
organize your test automation test runs with clear and concise
manner. Projects are also dependent on OS platform (e.g. Project can
be either Android or iOS project). There are no limitations on how
many projects you can create for your test automation.

**Test Run** - A test run includes your application (as
APK or IPA) and the test package (as APK, ZIP, JAR or some other
format). Each test run can be set to be executed on certain
devices. Devices can be selected when launching a test via test run
creation wizard or API.

**Device Group** - Devices where your app and tests will
be executed can be created and configured in Device Group view. This
wizard-like view allows you to create specific set of devices that can
be quickly select for your test runs. Device group can include either
Android or iOS devices (currently there is no possibility to run
cross-platform tests with one test runs). See the best practices
section on [How to Run Cross-Platform Tests](...LINKHERE...).
